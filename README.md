# so_long
## A simple 2D game in C that uses the MLX42 graphics library

A project created as part of my studies at Hive Helsinki.

To compile the project, run `make` (cmake and glfw need to be installed). Run the project in terminal with `./so_long <map_name>.ber`. There are several valid and invalid maps in the folder maps/ok and maps/ko, included in the repository. 

The game will open in a new window. The player can be controlled with the `W` `A` `S` `D` keys and `ESC` to exit. The monkey &#128018; must collect all the bananas &#127820; before it can leave through the exit and complete the game.
